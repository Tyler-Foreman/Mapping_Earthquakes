# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping earthquakes for Disaster Reporting Network using GeoJSON data.

The intent of this map is to visualize all of the earthquakes across the world over the last 7 days. There is a tectonic plateline filter for the map to understand how many earthquakes are away from the fault line. There is also a major earthquakes filter for any earthquake that has a magnitude over 4.
